# Speckit Constitution

This constitution outlines the foundational principles and standards for the Speckit project, ensuring high-quality development, reliable functionality, consistent user experiences, and optimal performance. It serves as a guiding framework for all contributors and stakeholders.

## Code Quality

- **Best Practices**: Adhere to established coding standards, including consistent naming conventions, proper indentation, and modular code structure.
- **Maintainability**: Write self-documenting code with clear comments, avoid code duplication, and ensure scalability through design patterns.
- **Review Process**: All code changes must undergo peer review to maintain quality and catch potential issues early.
- **Version Control**: Use meaningful commit messages and follow branching strategies to facilitate collaboration and traceability.

## Testing Standards

- **Coverage Requirements**: Aim for at least 80% code coverage across all components, with critical paths achieving 95% or higher.
- **Types of Tests**: Implement unit tests for individual functions, integration tests for component interactions, and end-to-end tests for user workflows.
- **Automation**: All tests must be automated and integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to run on every code change.
- **Quality Assurance**: Include performance, security, and accessibility testing in the test suite to ensure comprehensive validation.

## User Experience Consistency

- **Design Principles**: Follow a unified design language with consistent typography, color schemes, and layout patterns across all interfaces.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards, including keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and color contrast ratios.
- **Responsiveness**: Design interfaces that adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes and devices, prioritizing mobile-first approaches.
- **User Feedback**: Incorporate user testing and feedback loops to refine experiences and maintain consistency in interactions.

## Performance Requirements

- **Metrics**: Define key performance indicators such as page load times under 2 seconds, API response times under 500ms, and smooth 60fps animations.
- **Optimization Goals**: Minimize bundle sizes, optimize images and assets, and implement lazy loading to enhance loading performance.
- **Monitoring**: Establish continuous monitoring with tools for tracking performance metrics, error rates, and user engagement.
- **Scalability**: Design systems to handle growth, including efficient database queries, caching strategies, and horizontal scaling capabilities.

This constitution will be reviewed and updated annually or as needed to reflect evolving project needs and industry standards.
